    """Create an installer script from pkg_filegroups and friends.

    This macro allows users to create `bazel run`nable installation scripts
    using the pkg_filegroup framework.

    For example:

    ```python
    pkg_install(
        name = "install",
        srcs = [
            # mapping/grouping targets here
        ],
    )
    ```

    Installation can be done by invoking:

    ```
    bazel run -- //path/to:install
    ```

    Additional features can be accessed by invoking the script with the --help
    option:

    ```
    bazel run -- //path/to:install --help
    ```
    
    WARNING: While this rule does function when being run from within a bazel
    rule, such use is not recommended.  If you do, **always** use the
    `--destdir` argument to specify the desired location for the installation to
    occur.  Not doing so can lead the outputs going to an unexpected location,
    or in some cases, failing.  Run the script command with `--help`, as
    mentioned above, for more details.

    One such use would be to run the script created by `pkg_install` to produce
    a directory output in the build root.  This may not function as expected or
    may suffer from poorly tested edge cases.  A purpose-written rule that would
    allow for creation of such directories is discussed in
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/issues/388.
