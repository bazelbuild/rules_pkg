"""RPM packaging interfaces

This module provides a wrapper macro "pkg_rpm" that allows users to select
between the two variants of `pkg_rpm`:

- `pkg_rpm_pfg`, which arranges contents via the `pkg_filegroup`
  framework defined in `:mappings.bzl`.

- `pkg_rpm_legacy`, which arranges contents via a spec file template.

`pkg_rpm_legacy` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of
rules_pkg.

The mechanism for choosing between the two is documented in the function itself.
